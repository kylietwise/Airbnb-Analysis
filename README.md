FINAL PROJECT 

This project investigates what characteristics are important in producing a high reservation rate for an Airbnb listing. This information is important considering that the Covid-19 pandemic has hurt the hospitality industry, and determining which factors are important in helping listings get reserved may provide guidance as to how Airbnb can assist hosts to continue receiving reservations and sustain their business. The data used for this analysis are listing information for Airbnbs in New York City from January 2020 to March 2021, which was obtained from Insideairbnb.com. The data includes information about listings such as their physical characteristics, corresponding host information, prices, and the days which they were reserved within a year. Through descriptive analysis, it was revealed that the number of reservations booked within a month increased during 2020. Additionally, the number of bookings within the first three months of 2021 was less than the first three months of 2020. Through predictive analysis, specifically random forest modeling, it was revealed that the most important variables that play a factor in customers' decision to reserve a listing are the total number of listings a host has, the number of people it accommodates, the minimum nights required to stay, whether the host is a superhost, and price.
